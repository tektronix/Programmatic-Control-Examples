# Time Saving Screenshots to Local PC 

This example saves inverted color screenshots of the MSO5 or MSO6 series Oscilloscope Screen to a local PC.  It also shows the time it takes to do each save and an average of the saves so that you can get a good idea of how long it will take on your system.  This example has been tested using ethernet or USB connection from PC to the oscilloscope.  I have added some error checking to show how that can be used. It was written using Python 3.8, but will probably work using 3.7 or 3.6.
