# AWG70k/SourceXpress RF Generic Control/Send Custom Marker Data
Original Attribution: tekzilla

The script below creates a waveform with the RF Generic Signal waveform module in the AWG70k/SourceXpress using a text file containing the symbol values. This text file is also used to populate the marker channels with the symbol values.

The code can also be found in this repository (along with the text file used as the pattern):
