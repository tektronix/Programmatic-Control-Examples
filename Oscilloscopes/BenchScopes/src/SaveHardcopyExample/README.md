# Save Hardcopy Example
Original Attribution: Dave W. - Tektronix Applications

This example demonstrates how to use PyVISA to save hard copy screen images to the PC from TBS1000B, TBS1000, TDS200, TDS1000/2000, TDS1000B/2000B, TDS1000C-EDU/TDS2000C, TDS2024C, TPS2000/TPS2000B Series scopes.

My objective with this example was to create a single code example that works for all three of the interfaces on these instruments (GPIB, USB, and RS-232). RS-232 makes the code slightly more complex but, overall it's not too bad.
